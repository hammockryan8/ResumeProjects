These are my projects that are listed in my resume

AndroidChess is the "Android App Chess" listed in my resume and Jensen-Shannon Distance Calculator is 
the "Jensen-Shannon Distance Calculator" also listed in my resume. Both of these were large scale 
collaborative projects my courses so they are both folders with multiple smaller programs that work
together to their own respective tasks. AndroidChess was made in Android Studio and the Jensen-Shannon
Distance Calculator was written on a text file and compiled using the GNU Compiler Collection manually
through Linux's terminal.

The program RadioBot.js is the "Discord Radio Bot" listed in my resume and facultywebscraper.py is the
"Chemistry Department Faculty Web Scraper" also listed in my projects. The first one was a personal
project and the second one was made during my time as a research assistant. These two were smaller scale
than AndroidChess and the Jensen-Shannon Distance Calculator (although facultywebscraper.py is much 
longer than RadioBot.js) so they are just single files on the GitHub. Both of these projects were
written and compiled in Visual Studio Code.
